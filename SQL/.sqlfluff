# Excluding the following rules:
#   - L022: Blank line expected after CTE declaration
#       - Requires a blank line followed by comma on its own line for multiple declarations
#   - L031: Avoid table aliases in from clauses and join conditions
#       - Leads to unnecessarily verbose syntax
#   - L045: Defines a CTE but does not use it
#       - Can have false positives with large gap between CTE declaration and use
