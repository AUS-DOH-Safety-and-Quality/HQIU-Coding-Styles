# HQIU Python Coding Style

This document provides an outline of HQIU's coding style in Python.

## Purpose

This Python style guide helps contribute to the goal of the Healthcare Quality Intelligence team in producing reprodcible and transparent code. Adhering to rules outlined in this style guide helps to improve our ability to share, maintain, and develop analytical workflows in cases where Python is used. 

This is designed for those in the HQIU team or those interested in writing Python code that is clear and can be shared and maintained.

## Principles

In line with the HQIU R style guide.

* We take a disciplined and practical approach to writing code.
* We regularly check-in code to Github
* We believe consistency in style is very important.
* We demonstrate intent explicitly in code, via clear structure and comments where needed.
