# HQIU Coding Styles
Repository for documenting and implementing linter configurations for coding styles within the unit

Please see each repo for more detailed guides on coding styles for each language.

The official Department of Health Style Guide previously specified a Vancouver style, but in 2021 recommended the style preferred by the readership (if publishing in Journals).  For ease, either the APA standard or the Vancouver style (more commonly used in medical journals) are fine.
